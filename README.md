If you are a mobile developer, you understand the importance of a faster API and a more flexible API.

But API’s are designed for multiple clients each with different requirements and more often you will find that those API’s are not optimized for mobile apps. That is where newer technologies like GraphQL can help.

GraphQL is a query language for you API, that gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. If you have not read about GraphQL explore more at <http://graphql.org/>.
